## Project Overview & Problem Statement

**HabitFlow** is an mobile habit tracker application that is safe and allows users to create regular routines and maintains their data confidential and easy to understand.A lot of available habit apps can be overly dependent on cloud storage, complex to use, or offer poor views of progress, which can discourage users to continue with their habits overtime.

The primary objectives of the project are to deliver easy habit creation and tracking, strong authentication using bcrypt, categorization of habits with AI help, and easy analytics that can be used by student, professionals and health conscious users.

## 🤖 Emerging Tech Explanation (AI Categorization)

HabitFlow operates on a categorization engine that is AI-like and works on-device to propose a category as the user enters a name of a habit into the mobile app. This makes it easier to create habits since the user does not have to hand-think about categories, and it ensures that there are no conflicting categories since the analytics screen can calculate more accurate streaks and completion disaggregation. 

The engine is put as a rule based system that strategy is a mixture of dictionary of keywords, patterned regressions and fuzzy matching of the strings to rank each possible category and select the one that matches with the most confidence. All the operations occur locally on the Android/iOS device without any external API calls, which has the benefit of making the feature fast, private, and accessible offline, however at the cost of having the system not to automatically learn based on data and being most effective with English names of habits in its current state.

---
## 💻Setup & Run Instructions

HabitFlow is developed with Flet and SQLite and packaged as a mobile application for Android and iOS, while still supporting local development from source.

**For end users (Mobile build)**

- Install the Habitflow mobile application on an Mobile Devices using the provided build
- On first launch, create an account, then start adding and tracking habits directly from the mobile interface.

For Developers (run from source)
1. **Prerequisites**
 - Python 3.8 or Higher installed on your Pc/Laptop.
 - pip package manager and optionally Fit for cloning the repository
 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lililhuan/Habit-Flow.git
cd Habit-Flow
```
3. Create virtual enviroment 

**Windows:**
```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install Dependencies 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
this install Flet, bcrypt, pytest, and other requirements libraries

5. Configure environment 
- Copy .env.example to .env and adjust values such as database name and security setting if needed.
6.  Run the application
```bash
python app/main.py
```

Or using Flet CLI:
```bash
flet run app/main.py
```
this launches the app in a development enviroment so it can be tested or debug before mobile packaging.

7. Troubleshooting 
- If modules are missing, rerun pip install -r requirements.txt.

- If the database is locked or corrupted, delete the SQLite .db file so the app recreates it on next run.

- If Python is not recognized, ensure it is added to your system PATH.

The Activity tab shows recent login activity:
- A list of login events with email address and timestamp.
- A quick status label such as Success for successful logins.
- This view helps admins monitor whether accounts are being accessed as expected and supports manual security reviews.

### 5.3 Security Logs
![Admin Logs](../docs/screenshots/14_admin_dashboard_logs.png)

The Logs tab shows security-related events, such as:
- Successful logins, logouts, and sign‑ups.
- Failed login attempts that may indicate incorrect passwords or attempted brute‑force attacks.
- Each entry includes the event type, email, and timestamp, and can optionally be exported for auditing.

## 6. Security Features (User View)
Even though most security logic is behind the scenes, users should be aware of:
- **Password protection** – All passwords are stored as secure bcrypt hashes; plain text passwords are never saved.
- **Account lockout** – After several incorrect password attempts, the account may temporarily lock to protect against guessing attacks.
- **Local data storage** – All habits and progress are stored locally on the device; exporting and backing up data is under the user’s control.

Good practices:
- Use strong, unique passwords for HabitFlow.
- Regularly export your data if you plan to change or reset your device.

## 7. Tips for Effective Habit Tracking
- Start with a small number of habits (3–5) so you don’t feel overwhelmed.
- Set realistic frequencies (daily or a few times per week) instead of “perfect” schedules you can’t maintain.
- Check the Today view at a consistent time each day—morning or evening—to mark completions and review progress.
- Use the Stats tab weekly to see which areas you’re improving in and which ones need attention.

## 🧪Testing Summary
HabitFlow uses an automated test suite built with pytest and pytest-cov and manual testing of the mobile user interface. The automated tests are used to test the core business logic of authentication, database operations, habit management and analytics using an in-memory SQLite database in a manner that is isolated and repeatable.​

There are a total 62 automated tests in four major test files authentication, database, habit service and analytics service and they are all currently passing with an overall coverage of approximately 88 percent and each individual core modules coverage of 83-92 percent. To create an HTML coverage report, developers can run the suite at the project root with pytest -v to give detailed output or pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html to create an HTML coverage report and package new mobile builds.

## Risk / Constraint Notes & Future Enhancements

### ⚠️Risks and Mitigations of the project.

The primary technical and security risks of HabitFlow are the loss of data, compromised passwords, performance, and mobile device platform peculiarities. The risk of data loss is minimized with the help of SQLite and support of the JSON export backup, whereas the risk of the password breach is minimized with the help of the bcrypt hashing with the salt, strict password policies, and account lock-out option after several failures. Other security threats like brute-force attacks, SQL injections and session grabbing are addressed using lockout settings, query parameters and sensitively handling sensitive information in memory. 

### 🚧Constraints

The project is limited to a local-only SQLite storage, i.e. data is stored on one mobile device with no inbuilt cloud sync. The other limitations are the limited amount of time to develop in a semester, the team size of three people, Material Design 3 UI choice, only English-only interface, and test on devices and emulators that the group had. 

### 🔮Future Enhancements

The intended improvements aim at enhancing the current mobile version with future expansion in terms of features and scalability. Short-term focus will be added cloud backup and sync, push notifications or reminders, and more refined mobile builds and widgets, and medium-term will be social features, gamification, calendar integration, and ML-based predictions of habit success. In the long term, the ideas include an AI-based coach, integration with wearables, enterprise/team-level, even better security with 2-factor or bio-metric authentication, and optional migration to cloud databases and CI/CD pipelines as the application grows.

## Individual Reflection

### 👨‍💻Roinel James Llesis 

**Learning Reflection**

This project altered my perception of application development, as well as my learning process. Until HabitFlow, I largely considered an app to be a set of features, here I saw the extent to which there are numerous layers, design, security, testing, documentation, and teamwork are all occurring simultaneously. I experienced the contrast between merely going through a tutorial and making decisions, troubleshooting problems that were not that self-evident, and having to live with those choices throughout the project. Mentally it was at times exhausting, yet it taught me to be less impatient and more interested in finding out how things actually work behind the scenes.

Among the largest lessons that I got was the value of iteration. The concepts which seemed perfect in my headhead had to be simplified or redone after we had tried them in the application. I came to value feedback and view bugs as opportunities to learn rather than to fail and apply tests and documentation as an opportunity to learn more about the system. Collaborating with colleagues also allowed me to learn more about the importance of communicating more effectively, seeking assistance sooner, and relying on the strengths of other employees. In general, this project has allowed me to feel more comfortable in complex and uncertain situations and enhance my drive to continue learning how to develop better and more secure applications.

### 👨‍💻Jeric Romance 

**Learning Reflecetion**

For me, The project was mainly about learning how to think of data and reliability. I was more enlightened that any design choice comes with effects of determining its ease of storage, recall and reliability with time. Using a real database helped me observe structure such as relationships, constraints and edge cases when working in small tasks that we do not always see. It made me go ahead and ask questions like what would happen when the user erases this? or "How can we ensure records remain consistent that transformed my approach to problems overall.

I also was taught much about my learning style. I observed that I got more mistakes whenever I attempted to hurry and anything that concerned data. The need to slow down and read errors carefully, sketch schemes, and ask the team to talk over ideas actually helped to save time in the long run. The project demonstrated to me that it is not bad to be ignorant of something initially, provided that I am ready to research, test and revise my knowledge. It also helped me to value teamwork, as most of the solutions that were good were achieved through discussions and not by an individual. This experience made me continue developing my knowledge in the direction of backend and data-related subjects and remain receptive to feedback and new ideas.

### 👨‍💻Justine Aaron Sarcauga

**Learning Reflection**

HabitFlow turned out to be an educational process of how users experience software in their real life. I began to notice things that I previously ignored, like the number of steps required to accomplish something, whether the labels are easy to understand, and the layouts on a small screen. I noticed that the slightest modification of the wording or the position could make or break the app; it would be either more comfortable or more difficult. This got me paying closer attention not just to our project, but also to the apps that I use on a daily basis and I started to give myself a reverse-engineering of why some designs feel more comfortable than others.

The other significant aspect of my learning was the way to work out frustration constructively. Sometimes the designs failed to do the required job or some alterations caused frustration on another design and the initial thought that came to my mind was that I was caught in between. Gradually I came to know that it is better to divide any problem into small parts, experiment with ideas, discuss others with me and not attempt to solve everything myself. I also began to value testing and documentation as a means to aid in learning since they compel you to have a clear understanding of what the software is supposed to accomplish. The project made me feel even more confident that I will continue to become a better developer, particularly in the area of developing user-friendly applications.
